In this project studied the different aspects that effect the churn rate of customers in the gym chain "Model Fitness". We learned to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer, drew up typical user portraits: selected the most outstanding groups, described their main features, drew basic conclusions and developed recommendations on how to improve customer service.
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<h3>Task:</h3>

- Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
- Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
- Analyze the factors that impact churn most
- Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
  - Identify target groups
  - Suggest measures to cut churn
  - Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers

<h3>Description of the data:</h3>

The dataset contains data on churn for a given month and information on the month preceding it.

The file `gym_churn_us.csv` contains the following columns:

- `Churn` — the fact of churn for the month in question

- User data for the preceding month:

  - `gender`

  - `Near_Location` — whether the user lives or works in the neighborhood where the gym is located

  - `Partner` — whether the user is an employee of a partner company (the gym has partner companies whose employees get discounts; in those cases the gym stores information on customers' employers)

  - `Promo_friends` — whether the user originally signed up through a "bring a friend" offer (they used a friend's promo code when paying for their first membership)

  - `Phone` — whether the user provided their phone number

  - `Age`

  - `Lifetime` — the time (in months) since the customer first came to the gym

- Data from the log of visits and purchases and data on current membership status:

  - `Contract_period` — 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year

  - `Month_to_end_contract` — the months remaining until the contract expires

  - `Group_visits` — whether the user takes part in group sessions

  - `Avg_class_frequency_total` — average frequency of visits per week over the customer's lifetime

  - `Avg_class_frequency_current_month` — average frequency of visits per week over the preceding month

  - `Avg_additional_charges_total` — the total amount of money spent on other gym services: cafe, athletic goods, cosmetics, massages, etc.
